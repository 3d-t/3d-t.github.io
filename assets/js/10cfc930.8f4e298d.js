For example, an SLA may describe that the temperature in certain locations should be between 18 and 22 degrees celcius during business hours. The difference between monitoring and automation is that automation is used to control devices. Monitoring only checks is measurements are between certain values and has less implication in case of configuration errors. Automation and monitoring are complementary because automation can be used to make sure that certain conditions are met, for example temperature or humidity, by controlling devices.
