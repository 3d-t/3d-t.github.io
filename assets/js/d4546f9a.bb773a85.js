Similarly to nerves in a living creature, signals\ncan be transported over wired connections, WIFI, bluetooth, 4G, Zwave or ZigBee. Data formats includes text messages, structured data in JSON format, images or documents. In case there are no sensors, people may manually gather the data by completing checklists and inspections. Data may also acquired by asking people for opinions via surveys or assessing their qualifications with a test or quiz.\nThe acquired data is converted into a common format for long term storage in memory.

In enterprise systems the rate of sales per month can be used to forecast and project, taking into account various parameters such as seasonality and marketing investments.

When dealing with systems, acting may involve the activation of a control such as a thermostat, valve or motor. When dealing with people acting may involve sending a notification about anomalies or non-compliance with the request to take action. Sometimes a combination of acting and notification is used.\nFor example, with self-driving cars the car should remain in the lane with a constant speed. When a deviation from the desired state is detected the car takes action by sending a signal to a motor that controls the steering system. However, when the car does not know how to handle a situation a notification is sent to the driver to take immediate action. In biology, the autonomous nervous system immediately triggers a muscle to retract your hand when the surface is too hot. When the body can not automatically solve the problem it sends a message like a pain signal to force you to slow down and inspect the problem."})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:a}={...(0,s.R)(),...e.components};return a?(0,o.jsx)(a,{...e,children:(0,o.jsx)(l,{...e})}):l(e)}},34223(e,a,t){t.d(a,{A:()=>n});const n=t.p+"assets/images/concept-cce60a4995b0835caa5fba248f9d11fe.png"},28453(e,a,t){t.d(a,{R:()=>i,x:()=>r});var n=t(96540);const o={},s=n.createContext(o);function i(e){const a=n.useContext(s);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(a):{...a,...e}},[a,e])}function r(e){let a;return a=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(o):e.components||o:i(e.components),n.createElement(s.Provider,{value:a},e.children)}}}]);
