# 3D-T: Spacetime monitoring and control

This is a website for a new platform for integrating the IoT, Machine learning and Digital Twins for time-based and location-based data.  The platform is under active development and includes the following functionality:

* Importing JSON and CSV data sources.
* Connecting to IoT devices and platforms.
* Setting up custom integrations with Javascript or Docker containers.
* Manual data acquisition via inspections forms, surveys.
* Trend analysis and forecasting based on regression and neural networks.
* Spefifying rules for monitoring and control of data and devices using a visual programming language.
* Visualization of time- and location-based data in charts and maps.
* 3D visualization of IoT parameters via GLTF or IFC BIM models.
* 3D visualization of IoT parameters using a built-in solid modeler with a visual programming environment.
* Building custom sensors and controllers with ESP32 using C++ or Rust.
* Deployment with Kubernetes on Odroid, Raspberry, Linux and cloud platforms.
